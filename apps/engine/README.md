# electric-circuits-engine

The Rust engine at the center of [electric-circuits](../../README.md): a durable-streams client that
turns Postgres logical-replication changes into incrementally-maintained **shapes**, **subquery
inner-sets**, and **scalar aggregations** — one maintained stream per *distinct* definition,
ref-counted and shared across subscribers. It serves two HTTP surfaces from one process:

- the **control plane** (`/schema`, `/shapes`, `/aggregate`, `/query`, introspection), used by
  `@electric-circuits/api`;
- the **Electric-compatible `GET /v1/shape`**, so an unmodified ElectricSQL client can sync from it.

Design and execution model: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/ivm-engine-internals.md](../../docs/ivm-engine-internals.md).

## Build & run

```bash
cargo build -p electric-circuits-engine          # or: pnpm engine:build (repo root)
cargo test  -p electric-circuits-engine          # or: pnpm engine:test

ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8791 \
ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_URL=postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres \
ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_TABLES='*' \
target/debug/electric-circuits-engine
```

The engine prints `ENGINE_LISTENING <url>` to **stdout** (logs go to stderr) so a harness can
discover the bound port.

## Environment

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_DS_URL` | *(required)* | Durable-streams server base URL (the change log) |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_URL` | *(unset)* | Enables **Postgres mode**: ingest via logical replication, backfill by query-back. Unset = library mode (writes arrive on table streams) |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_TABLES` | *(empty)* | Comma list of tables to replicate; `*` (or empty) introspects every `public` table with a primary key |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_SLOT` | `electric_circuits` | Logical replication slot name |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_POLL_MS` | `50` | Replication-slot poll interval |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_BIND` | `127.0.0.1:0` | Bind address (`:0` = ephemeral port) |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_LOG` | `info` | `tracing` EnvFilter (e.g. `warn`, `electric_circuits_engine=debug`) |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_TRACE` | `1` (on) | `0`/`false`/`off` unregisters the introspection surface (`/trace` SSE, `/graph`, `/graph/node`, `/state`, `/state/node` — the pipeline-visualizer backend). When on, it costs ~nothing until a client subscribes (and stays unauthenticated — see the deployment doc) |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SHAPE_IDLE_SECS` | `1800` | Retention: idle time (no engine-visible reads, refcount 0) before an active shape goes **dormant** (engine state dropped; stream + record retained). `0` disables dormancy |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SHAPE_DORMANT_TTL_SECS` | `604800` (7 days) | Retention: how long a shape may stay dormant before it is **evicted** (stream + record deleted). `0` disables the TTL layer |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_MAX_SHAPES` | `10000` | Retention: total shape-count cap; over it, least-recently-read **dormant** shapes are evicted (active shapes never are). `0` = unlimited |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SHAPE_DISK_BUDGET_MB` | `0` (disabled) | Retention: cap on shape-stream bytes (engine-side accounting of appended bytes — resets on restart); over it, least-recently-read dormant shapes are evicted |
| `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_RETENTION_SWEEP_SECS` | `60` | Retention: background sweep interval |
| `ELECTRIC_HANDLE_TTL` | `600` | Seconds a `/v1/shape` handle may sit idle before its **handle state** is evicted and its shape subscription released (the shape + stream are retained and follow the retention lifecycle); a late request gets `409 must-refetch` and rejoins the retained shape |
| `ELECTRIC_LIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `20000` | Overall deadline for a `live=true` `/v1/shape` long-poll, then `204` |

### Benchmarking-fleet surface (`ELECTRIC_*`)

The engine also accepts Electric's own env surface so the `electric-circuits` image is a drop-in for
`electricsql/electric` in the [benchmarking-fleet](../../docs/fleet-conformance.md). These are resolved
in `config.rs`; the `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_*` vars above always **win** (dev/test behavior is unchanged). Any
unknown `ELECTRIC_*` var is accepted and logged once as "accepted (no-op)" — it never crashes boot.

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | *(unset)* | Postgres URL (tolerates `?sslmode=disable`); `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_PG_URL` wins |
| `ELECTRIC_PORT` | `3000` when set / under `DATABASE_URL` | Binds `0.0.0.0:<port>`; `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_BIND` wins |
| `ELECTRIC_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `error`/`warning`/`info`/`debug` → log filter; `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_LOG` wins |
| `ELECTRIC_REPLICATION_STREAM_ID` | *(unset)* | Slot name `electric_slot_<id>`; also the `stack_id` metric tag |
| `ELECTRIC_INSTANCE_ID` | generated UUID | Tags every StatsD metric `instance_id:<id>` |
| `ELECTRIC_STATSD_HOST` | *(unset → StatsD off)* | `host[:port]` (default port 8125) StatsD destination |
| `TELEMETRY_POLLER_PERIOD` / `ELECTRIC_SYSTEM_METRICS_POLL_INTERVAL` | `5s` | Periodic-metrics interval (ms / human duration; the latter wins) |
| `ELECTRIC_SECRET` | *(unset)* | If set, `/v1/shape` requires `secret`/`api_secret` query param (else `401`) |
| `ELECTRIC_INSECURE` | *(unset)* | Accepted; no-op when no secret |
| `ELECTRIC_STORAGE_DIR` | *(unset)* | If set + exists, `du`'d every ~60s → `electric.storage.used.bytes` |

**`GET /v1/health`** reports the boot state machine as an exact, whitespace-free JSON body:
`{"status":"waiting"}` (202) until Postgres connects, `{"status":"starting"}` (202) through
introspection/slot/ingest spawn, then `{"status":"active"}` (200). Library mode is `active` at once.
A fourth state sits outside that machine: `{"status":"degraded"}` (503), reported once subquery
membership work has been **lost** (`/replication/lsn` → `flipFailures` > 0). The fan-out frontier is
frozen and the data endpoints (`/v1/shape`, `/shapes/{id}/rows`, `/shapes/{id}/log`, `/query`) answer
503 as well: membership is known to be wrong, and nothing in the engine repairs it. Observability
keeps serving. Recovery is a restart, which re-seeds every node from Postgres.
`GET /` → 200 empty; `OPTIONS /v1/shape` → 204 with `access-control-allow-methods`.

**StatsD telemetry** (`statsd.rs`) is the fleet's only metrics channel — the datadog wire format
(`name:value|type|#instance_id:<id>,...`), non-blocking (bounded channel → batched ≤1432-byte UDP
datagrams), off unless `ELECTRIC_STATSD_HOST` is set. It emits a periodic system-metrics table
(`system.*`/`vm.*`, sampled with `sysinfo`) plus event metrics at the HTTP, replication, storage, and
snapshot paths. Only genuinely-measured values are emitted; anything unmeasurable on the host is
omitted, never faked. The existing `GET /metrics` (JSON) + `GET /metrics/prometheus` (OTel) are
unchanged.

## HTTP endpoints

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | liveness |
| `POST /schema` | define the schema (library mode; Postgres mode self-configures by introspection) |
| `POST /shapes` | create a shape (`table`, `where`, `columns`, `changesOnly`) — identical definitions share one stream |
| `POST /aggregate` | create a live scalar aggregation (`table`, `where`, `fn`, `col`) |
| `GET /shapes/{id}` / `DELETE /shapes/{id}` | look up a shape (incl. its retention `state`) / release one subscription — the shape is retained and ages through the retention lifecycle. `DELETE …?purge=true` force-drops it immediately (admin/debug; the visualizer's trash) |
| `GET /shapes/{id}/rows` | current contents of an existing shape (folds its stream; visualizer preview) |
| `GET /shapes/{id}/log` | tail of a shape's stream as-is (op/key/value/lsn) — the visualizer's feed change log |
| `POST /query` | one-shot subset query: `SELECT … ORDER BY … LIMIT/OFFSET` + snapshot LSN |
| `GET /trace` | SSE: per-envelope pipeline traces (hops + outcomes) and `shapeAdded`/`shapeDropped` lifecycle events; lossy by design, zero cost with no subscribers |
| `GET /tables/{name}/offset` · `GET /tables/{name}/families` | tailer position / routing-family stats |
| `GET /subqueries` · `GET /graph` · `GET /graph/node?sig=…` | shared-node stats, pipeline graph, one node's live index |
| `GET /replication/lsn` | ingest head, fan-out frontier (`sequencedLsn`), sync status, `pendingFlips`, `flipFailures` |
| `GET /metrics` · `POST /metrics/reset` · `GET /memory` · `GET /metrics/prometheus` | counters/histograms, memory snapshot, OTel/Prometheus exposition |
| `GET /v1/shape` | Electric protocol: snapshot (`offset=-1`), live long-poll, handles/offsets/`must-refetch` |

The `/v1/shape` adapter parses Electric's SQL `where` grammar and is validated against Electric's own
oracle/property/integration tests ([electric-conformance/](../../electric-conformance/README.md)).

## Shape retention lifecycle

Shapes follow a three-tier lifecycle (`src/retention.rs`) instead of delete-on-last-unsubscribe —
a deliberate divergence from upstream Electric, which keeps every retained shape actively
maintained:

- **Active** — maintained live. Unsubscribing (`DELETE /shapes/{id}`, `/v1/shape` handle expiry)
  does not deactivate; brief reconnects rejoin the same warm stream.
- **Dormant** — after `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_SHAPE_IDLE_SECS` with no reads and no subscribers: engine
  routing state is dropped, the durable stream and shape record are retained at zero engine cost.
  Any touch (rejoin, `/v1/shape` re-snapshot, rows/log read) reactivates by replaying the
  `table/<name>` stream from the captured resume offset — no Postgres backfill.
- **Evicted** — stream + record deleted. Returning `/v1/shape` clients get `409 must-refetch` and
  re-snapshot; extended-API clients get `404` and recreate.

Eviction is layered, least-recently-read first, and **dormant-only** (active shapes are never
evicted): the dormancy TTL (hygiene), the `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_MAX_SHAPES` count cap (engine cost bound),
and the disk budget (hard backstop). When a cap/budget is exceeded with nothing dormant to evict,
the engine logs loudly and bumps the `retention_pressure` metric instead of evicting.

Subquery and aggregate shapes never go dormant (their state is not rebuildable from a bounded
replay); once unsubscribed, the TTL layer instead evicts them straight from active after the same
total grace an ordinary shape gets (idle timeout + dormancy TTL). Lifecycle state is in-memory
today — restart recovery (persistent catalog, GH #8) will persist it.
