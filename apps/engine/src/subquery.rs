//! Subquery support: shared, incrementally-maintained inner-set **nodes** and the cross-table
//! registry that moves outer rows in/out as inner sets change.
//!
//! A shape whose `WHERE` contains `col IN (SELECT proj FROM inner WHERE pred)` (or `NOT IN`) cannot be
//! evaluated row-locally — membership depends on the inner subquery's result set. We maintain that set
//! once per distinct subquery (keyed by a canonical [`SubquerySig`]) as a [`SubqueryNode`]: a map from
//! projected value to the set of inner-row primary keys producing it. A value is "in the set" iff its
//! contributor set is non-empty; tracking contributor pks (not a bare count) makes maintenance
//! reconcile-by-identity — set a row's presence to equal `match(row)` regardless of history.
//!
//! Identical subqueries share one node (the memory win + the sharing the design calls for). Nodes feed
//! dependents — outer shapes or *parent* nodes (a node whose inner `pred` itself references this node) —
//! along edges recorded by connecting column. When a value flips (a bucket goes empty↔non-empty), the
//! registry queries the dependent rows referencing that value and re-evaluates them (see
//! `on_table_delta`, added in a later step). This file (step 6) is the pure in-memory core: node
//! maintenance + the [`SubqueryEval`] read view. No Postgres, no streams yet.

// --- deferred flip propagation ------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Runs on the engine's flip-worker pool (semaphore-bounded, `ELECTRIC_CIRCUITS_FLIP_WORKERS`), NOT
// inside the table tailers, so the flip-driven Postgres query-backs neither sit on the tailer
// hot path nor serialize on a single task. Two invariants make this sound:
//
//  * **Deferral**: every emission is absolute (per pk: upsert if the row matches *now*, else
//    idempotent delete), so a propagation that runs later re-derives from the then-current
//    Postgres and node state and converges regardless of when — or on which worker — it runs.
//    The convergence barrier gains one term: the engine's pending counter must drain to zero
//    (`GET /replication/lsn` → `pendingFlips`), and that counter also covers emission-lane
//    batches until they LAND on their streams.
//  * **Eval+enqueue atomicity + per-stream FIFO**: membership evaluation and the enqueue of the
//    resulting envelopes happen under one registry-lock scope, and each shape stream drains
//    through exactly one ordered emission lane (`engine::emission`). Per-stream append order
//    therefore equals evaluation order — a move evaluated at time t1 can never land *after* an
//    emission evaluated at t2 > t1 for the same pk (which would leave the stream's last word
//    stale — permanent divergence). This is the same guarantee the old
//    hold-the-lock-across-append design gave, without network under the lock and without a
//    single-task bottleneck. Postgres round-trips run outside the lock, concurrently.
